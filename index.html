      <img src="Assets/Images/Ahmed Image.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My name is Ahmed Ahmed. I was born in Nairobi Kenya. I came to United States at the age of 4years old, and never went back.
      </p>

      <p> Looking back I’m glad I was able to come here. I don’t think I would have had the same opportunities in life. I went to high school in Saint Paul Minnesota. </p>

      <p>I started playing soccer and every other sport you can think of. I was a sports junkie. The deep love I had for sports carried on even after high school. What can you say, sports was my first love. Till his day I’m looking places to play ball or even to workout. </p>
